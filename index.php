                    Hello! I’m <b>Martin Šteidler</b>, and this is my personal website. I’m glad you’re here, because I
                    want to
                    share
                    with you a little bit about myself and what I do. I’m currently working as an <b>IT Analyst</b> at
                    <b>ČSOB</b>. I am passionate about
                    <b>Bitcoin, Deep Learning, AI, 3D Printing, Robotics and Automation</b> and I love to share my work
                    and
                    insights with the world. I started learning about the <b>IT world</b> when I was <b>19</b>, and
                    since
                    then I’ve never stopped exploring and experimenting with new technologies and tools. I’m also a
                    <b>biohacker</b>, and I enjoy <b>tracking and analyzing</b> various aspects of my health and
                    performance.
                    I believe that <b>data is power</b>, and that by measuring and optimizing our biometrics, we can
                    achieve
                    our full potential.

                    Besides my professional interests, I also have some personal hobbies that show my personality and
                    passions. For example, I enjoy <b>reading classical works of literature</b> from different eras and
                    regions. I admire the beauty and wisdom of the language and the stories. I love <b>playing chess</b>
                    with my friends and online opponents. I find it challenging and rewarding to apply my strategic
                    thinking
                    and problem-solving skills. I also like to <b>spend time in nature</b> I appreciate the tranquility
                    and
                    harmony of the natural environment and the opportunity to reconnect with myself.
                    In addition, I <b>work out occasionally</b> to keep myself fit and healthy.
                    I also <b>study pedagogy and economy</b> in my free time, as I am interested
                    in learning more about human behavior and social systems.
